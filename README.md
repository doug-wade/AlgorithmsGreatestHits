# AlgorithmsGreatestHits

Python 3 implementations of various algorithms and data structures for studying.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests for one class:

    python3 -m unittest path/to/class.py

For example, to run the hashmap tests:

    python3 -m unittest data_structures/hashmap.py

To run all unit tests:

    python3 -m unittest discover

## TODO

### Refactor
* data_structures
** split heaps into 3 files

### Unit test
* data_structures
** graph
** MinHeap
** MaxHeap
** TupleHeap
* graph_algorithms
** all of them (FOR SHAME)
* other_algorithms
** all of them (SLACKER)
